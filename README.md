# Project 2
After completing this project, you will:

    Gain experience using git via your CLI and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) Source Control
    Gain experience writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code
    Practice refactoring JavaScript code
    
Project elements:

    Use the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create and work with a git repository (repo)
    Refactor the JavaScript program from the previous project to practice using git and practice refactoring
    Use git via VSCode
        Create and use a .gitignore file
        Diff split screen

This project focused on **working with Git** (using both the CLI and VSCode), **refactoring JavaScript code**, and understanding **function expressions** in Node.js. The project builds on the solution from Project 1 and introduces structured coding, version control, and Git repository management.
